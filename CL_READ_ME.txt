Q / A: 

•	When I press the “Save Change Log” button, nothing happens:  Make sure there are no slashes or backslashes ( “/” or “\\”) as those are invalid characters. 
•	When I press the “View Logs” button, the program kills itself: In order to view the logs, you must first have logs created in the past. So just make a log and try again.
